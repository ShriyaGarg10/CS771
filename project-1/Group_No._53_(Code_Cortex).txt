Task 1:  
Validation accuracy on Dataset 1: 92% (LSTM)
                       Dataset 2: 99.18% (SVM)
                       Dataset 3: 93.99% (LSTM + XGBoost)
Task 2:
SVM was used finally to get the accuracy of 97%, which overall is better than the individual accuracies.

* Steps to run the code 
All 9 files need to be used to run the code. The respective paths of each file mush be updated to those of the local device before running the code.

Dataset 1 and Dataset 3 must be .h format before uploading.
